                Division Game: There are 2N gold coins sitting on a table, of different weights.
                Alice and Bob know all the weights, and they are going to split these coins up between
                themselves so they each get N coins. The way they will do so is as follows. Alice first
                picks a coin on the table, say x, Bob chooses who gets to keep x (him or Alice). Then Bob
                picks another coin y on the table, now Alice chooses who gets to keep y, and so on back
                and forth, until one player has N coins, at which point all the remaining coins go to the
                other player. Each player wants to maximise the sum of the weights of the coins that they get.
                It seems to be true, but we donâ€™t yet know how to prove, that Bob is always better off than Alice in this game!

            <h3>
                Week 1
            </h3>
            <p>
                We started thinking about our problem. At first, we solved some trivial examples.
                We played various games manually and we were thinking about general behavior of the problem.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Week 2
            </h3>
            <p>
                We defined rank and we tried to describe the problem using ordering. 
                We made a lot of conjenctures, but most of them failed after we had finished a solver.
                After a day of the lost hope, we came up with a conjencture that wasn't instantly disprooved via solver.
                We also prooved a theorem about values of coins. Since that moment,
                we could thinking just about distinct games with positive integer values.
                We also tried to find upper bounds for games, but all estimations were
                both true but useless, either useful but false.

            </p>

            <h3>
                Week 3
            </h3>

            <p>
                We prooved our conjencture for a = 2. It was trivial, but we were too much
                focused on general proof and we didn't think about that problem trivially.
